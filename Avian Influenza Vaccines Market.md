<p>Avian influenza is a viral infection caused by the type A virus prevalent in birds. The virus's most common carrier is aquatic birds. Based on the protein remaining on its surface (HA), avian influenza type A virus is classified as either neuraminidase (NA) or hemagglutinin (HA). Based on molecular characteristics, it is classed as either highly pathogenic or low pathogenic. The virus can cause serious sickness if it enters the eyes, nose, or mouth. The antiviral medicines oseltamivir and zanamivir are included in the Avian Influenza Vaccines for infection prevention and treatment. Ducks, chickens, geese, and other birds reportedly consume it.</p>
<p>Increasing government efforts to spread the news about avian influenza and funding for private-sector research to develop effective vaccines could drive market expansion over the study period. Strategic collaborations between corporate and public organizations and collaborative activities in the digitalization of medical aid facilities may aid in market growth. The increased prevalence of diseases in developing countries may contribute to the increase in poultry mortality. At the same time, more research is needed to create effective vaccinations for disease prevention due to the rising human consumption of chicken. Chickens can be genetically resistant to avian flu using gene editing methods.</p></p>
